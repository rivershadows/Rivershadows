<!-- q -->Hi, nice to meet you, I'm River. I'm a very shy person, I don't like to speak first, honestly... but that doesn't mean I'm not cool. Well, I think so. When I get comfortable, I'm like a bird, and also intense, to be honest. I'm not intense with just anyone, and I'm only affectionate with my special someone. I'm a bit boring sometimes, but I like listening to people, even though it sometimes makes me sleepy... I'm a non-binary person. I don't identify with any gender. I'm a duck, but I don't really care about pronouns. Call me whatever you want, but I feel more comfortable if you use male pronouns.
